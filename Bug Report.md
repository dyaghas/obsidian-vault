Bug Report (also called Defect Creation) is a report done by the QA team giving information about an incorrect behavior  that is happening in the software and has to be corrected. A `Bug Report` should have as much information as possible to make it easier for the development team to reproduce it, find its cause and correct it.

The first step is to document what steps are necessary to reproduce the bug so any developer can reproduce it. After that, it is also important to inform the data used such as usernames, passwords and URLs, the expected result and the actual one.

## Severity and Priority

- Severity: to what extent a defect can affect the application. For example: in store web page, a defect that does not allow a user to buy any products is a critical severity one because that's the entire purpose of the application.
- Priority: the order that should be applied to defect correction. A higher priority defect should be fixed before one with lower priority.

Note: in Agile, priority and severity are defined in a step called `Defect Triage` that happens after the defect was created. That's because not every QA employee will have the same idea of how high a priority or severity should be. Newer employees will have no domain knowledge to guess.
