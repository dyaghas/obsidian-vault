#algorithm

It is a better version of **Bubble Sort** because of its performance, being able to do fewer swaps but with the same worst-case time complexity. Selection Sort works in one of two ways: It either looks for the smallest item in the list and places it in the front of the list (ensuring that the item is in its correct location) or looks for the largest item and places it in the back of the list. Useful for sorting small arrays.
