Java is an **Object oriented programming language** (OOP), meaning that it is based on the concept of real life objects that can contain attributes, parameters and code in the form of procedures. Classes are used to group objects with similar characteristics in the same place.

**Java main method**: Can be defined in any **class**. Its purpose is to give a place where the code should be executed first. It looks like this:

```java
public static int main(String[] args) {
	code to be executed
}
```

**Object Oriented Programming**

The purpose of OOP is to match a program to a problem through real life examples. Data is represented as objects with their respective characteristics. Example: a blue car with four doors.

It has four pillars: [[Polymorphism]], [[Inheritance]], [[Abstraction]] and [[Encapsulation]]
