#basics 

Nothing more than a custom datatype. A factory that can produce data in a way defined by the programmer, this data is called an [object](Object.md). It is an object datatype, meaning it is defined by the user (programmer).

Classes are groups while objects are specific instances of said group. The human species is a class and you are an object. Classes can acquire characteristics of other classes through Inheritance. For example: the Human class is part of the LivingBeing class.

In java, classes are written in CamelCase, meaning the first letter of every word is in UPPERCASE.
