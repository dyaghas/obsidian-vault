#data_structure 

Type casting, also known as type conversion, is a process of converting a value from one [[Data type]] to another one. Example:

```java
int x = 10;
double y = (double) x;
System.out.println(y) //outputs 10.0
```

*When converting a floating-point value to an integer, the fractional part is truncated, not rounded.*
