Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. In other words, a function is defined in terms of itself, and the function call creates a loop of function calls.

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that can simplify code and make it more elegant. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems. For example, the classic example of recursion is the calculation of the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. To calculate the factorial of a number, the function calls itself with a smaller argument until it reaches the base case of 1, at which point it returns 1 and the function calls unwind.

Recursion can be implemented in many programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and more. However, it is important to be careful when using recursion, as it can lead to infinite loops and stack overflow errors if not implemented properly.
