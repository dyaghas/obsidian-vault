#data_structure

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable instead of declaring separate variables for each value. It is a data structure with fixed size that can hold items of the same data type and is indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

```java
//Array declaration
String[] cars;
```

```java
//Array declaration with value insertion
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
```

```java
//access an array element
System.out.println(cars[0]);
```
