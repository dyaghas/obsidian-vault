The main Volatile memory characteristic is that it requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but quickly loses its data when the power is interrupted.

It has several uses including **Primary storage** (the only type of memory directly accessible to the CPU), in addition to usually being faster than Non-volatile memory.

Example of Volatile memory:
