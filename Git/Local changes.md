## add

`git add` is used to add changes to the staging area. When you make changes to files in a Git repository, those changes are not automatically tracked. Instead, you need to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in the next commit. This is where `git add` comes in.

To add changes to the staging area, use the `git add` command followed by the name of the file(s) you want to add. For example, to add changes to a file called `myfile.txt`, you can run:

```git
git add myfile.txt
```

If you want to add all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories, you can use a dot `.` as a wildcard:

```git
git add .
```

Once you have added changes to the staging area, you can use the `git commit` command to create a new commit with those changes. Note that changes in the staging area are not part of any branch yet, and you can modify them by using `git add` again to stage additional changes or `git reset` to unstage changes.

## commit

`git commit` is used to create a new commit in the repository. A commit represents a snapshot of the repository at a particular point in time and includes a message describing the changes that were made.

To create a new commit, first make sure that you have added the changes you want to include in the commit to the staging area using `git add`. Then, use the `git commit` command followed by the `-m` option and a message describing the changes you made. For example, to create a new commit with the message "Update README.md", you can run:

```git
git commit -m "Update README.md"
```

You can also use the `-a` option to automatically stage any changes to files that are already tracked by Git and then commit them. For example:

```git
git commit -a -m "Update README.md"
```

This is a convenient shortcut if you have made changes to multiple files and want to commit them all at once.

Once you have created a commit, it becomes part of the Git repository's commit history. You can use `git log` to view the commit history and `git show <commit>` to view the details of a specific commit. It's a good practice to write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you made, as this makes it easier for others (and your future self!) to understand the history of the project.

## reset

`git reset` is used to reset the current state of the repository to a previous commit. This can be useful if you need to undo changes or go back to a previous version of the code.

Here are some common uses of `git reset`:

1.  Resetting the staging area: To unstage changes that you have added to the staging area, use the `git reset` command followed by the name of the file(s) you want to unstage. For example, to unstage changes to `myfile.txt`, you can run:
```git
git reset myfile.txt
```

If you want to unstage all changes in the staging area, you can use a dot `.` as a wildcard:

```git
git reset .
```

2.  Undoing changes: To undo changes you have made to a file since the last commit, use the `git reset` command followed by the name of the file(s) you want to reset. Note that this only affects the working directory and does not create a new commit.

3.  Moving the HEAD pointer: To reset the repository to a previous commit, use the `git reset` command followed by the SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to reset to. For example, to reset the repository to the commit with the hash `abc123`, you can run:

```git
git reset abc123
```

By default, this will move the HEAD pointer and the current branch pointer to the specified commit, effectively "undoing" any commits that came after it. This can be a dangerous operation, as it permanently removes any changes that were made in those commits.

Note that there are different modes of `git reset` that can have different effects on the repository state. The most common modes are `--mixed` (default), `--soft`, and `--hard`. It's important to be careful when using `git reset`, as it can permanently delete changes that have not been committed.

## pull

`git pull` is used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to the local one. When you and other collaborators work on the same repository, `git pull` helps you update your local repository with the changes made by others.

Here's how to use `git pull`:

1.  First, ensure that you are in the local branch you want to update. You can check which branch you're on with the `git branch` command.

2.  Next, run `git pull` followed by the name of the remote repository and the branch you want to update from. For example, to fetch and merge changes from the `main` branch of the `origin` remote, you can run:

```git
git pull origin main
```

This will fetch any changes made to the `main` branch on the `origin` remote and merge them into your local `main` branch.

Note that `git pull` is essentially equivalent to running `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. If you prefer to run those commands separately, you can do so by running `git fetch` to update the remote references, followed by `git merge` to merge the changes into your local branch.

It's important to note that `git pull` can potentially overwrite local changes, so it's a good practice to commit your changes or stash them before running `git pull`. Additionally, conflicts may arise if both you and another collaborator make changes to the same file(s), in which case Git will prompt you to resolve the conflicts manually.
