It is an activity that ensures that a product is working as intended based on the specifications given. In a software, it checks for any problems in performance, edge cases and errors that could be generated in its execution.

## Test Oracle

A Test Oracle is a mechanism that determines whether a test has passed or failed. The software output is compared with the `Test Oracle`,typically another software that is guaranteed to produce the right output.

## Testing approach

- Proactive testing: this approach objective is to make sure the code has as little bugs and problems as possible when its completed. To do so, a problem has to be considered and treated before it actually happens through coding standards, code reviews, automated analysis tools and training.
- Reactive testing: this approach reacts to problems as they are found through bug fixes, regression testing, bug reports etc.

There are three common approaches used to implement functional testing:

- Black Box Testing: checks if the correct output is generated through an input without any knowledge of the code that generated such results.
- White Box Testing: it tests the code robustness through an analysis of its code and testing of all possible paths. This type of test is commonly performed at the beginning of the development process with unit tests and into the early parts of the integration phase. Black box test work is typical of the latter phases where response to specific operating scenarios is important.
- Gray Box Testing: The third type of testing is a mixture of black and white box. This happens as development moves into a crossover zone towards the end of integration and the beginning of usability.
