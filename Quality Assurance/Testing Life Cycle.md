The `Testing Life Cycle is divided into` is a process that ensures a software meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It is divided into the following steps:

---------------
## Requirement analysis

The software objects and functionalities are analyzed to identify what needs to be tested, testing objectives and scope are defined here.

--------------------------
## Test Planning

Defines the strategy that will be implemented to test the software, including all tests activities that should be done. This document is created only after preparing the business requirements.

--------------------
## Test Case Development

In this step, the necessary test cases are developed according to the Agile Framework being followed, making sure that the specifications are met and the maximum amount of bugs possible are found and corrected.

#### Requirement Traceability Matrix

Establishes a relation between business requirements and the product's test cases. Makes visualizing which requirements where tested and what requirements a test case tests easier, ideally having at least one test for each requirement.

--------------
## Test Environment

A controlled and isolated environment where a software is tested. The objective is to replicate the production environment as closely as possible, allowing testers to see how the program will react to different situations and report/solve possible issues and bugs.

Usually there's multiple Testing Environments for a software to guarantee that all testers can work on it at the same time without overwriting one another's changes.

-----------------------------
## Test Execution

Step where all the tests are put in a QA environment and executed to catch any bugs and problems that arise, sending them back to the development team so they can be corrected and tested again through `Regression testing`.

------------------
## Test Closure

Last step in a `Testing Life Cycle`. Verifications are made to ensure that all tests where executed successfully, test coverage is completed and everything is okay.
