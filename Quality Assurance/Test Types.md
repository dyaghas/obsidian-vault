Tests are divided into two categories: **Functional Testing** and **Non-functional Testing:

-----------------------------------

## Functional Testing

Functional Testing verifies if every functionality of a software complies with its requirement. There are four types:

- Unit Testing: each software component is tested individually;
- Integration Testing: different components are integrated and tested together to see if they work as expected;
- System Testing: the system's hardware and software are tested altogether to see if its overall function works as intended;
- Acceptance Testing: verifies if the software is ready to be delivered.
- Regression testing: ensures that the application is stable and any changes like new features or bug fixes does not break the program. This is done after an already existing code is changed in any way.

--------------------------

## Non-functional Testing

Tests a program no-functional aspects such as security, reliability and quality.

- Performance Testing: tests an application efficiency under different circumstances. Branched into four categories: `Load Testing`, `Stress Testing`, `Endurance Testing` and `Spike Testing`;
- Security Testing: tests if a software has any security breaches; 
- Usability Testing: checks for usability and user-friendliness in a software;
- Compatibility Testing: the software is tested in different systems and environments.
