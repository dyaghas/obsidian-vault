#system 

**It is the core component of an operating system** that manages system resources, including the CPU, memory, input/output (I/O) devices, and file systems. It is responsible for providing a layer of abstraction between the hardware and software, allowing software applications to interact with hardware resources without having to know the details of the underlying hardware.

The kernel is one of the first programs loaded into memory when the computer boots up (after the **bootloader**) and remains there until the computer is shut down. It is always resident in memory and provides a range of services that allow software programs to access the hardware resources of the computer. These services include process management, memory management, device management, and security management.

It is designed to be small, efficient, and reliable, as it is critical to the overall performance and stability of the operating system. Different operating systems have different types of kernels, including monolithic kernels, microkernels, hybrid kernels, and exokernels.
