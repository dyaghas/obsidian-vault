#C 

A `BitField` is used in cases where **memory efficiency** is extremely important like in embedded systems. It manipulates groups of bits in a single data structure which allows for a more efficient way to manipulate data that does not require a full byte. This is useful because **in C, the smallest amount of memory that can be allocated is a byte**, so when allocating memory for a variable that needs 4 bits for example, the other 4 bits are "lost".

Example of a BitField:

```C
typedef struct LedStatusBitField {
  uint8_t led1 : 1;
  uint8_t led2 : 1;
  uint8_t led3 : 1;
} LedStatusBitField;
```

The code above stores 3 variables `led1`, `led2` and `led3`, each one of type unsigned int with 1 bit of memory allocated for it. Without a BitField, this structure would allocate 3 bytes of memory instead of 3 bits, 1 byte for each variable.
