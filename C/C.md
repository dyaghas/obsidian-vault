`C` is a programming language created in 1972 with the purpose of writing `UNIX` operating systems. It is fast, efficient and robust, being widely used for developing Operational Systems and embedded systems.

It stands out when compared to high level languages such as `Java` or `Python` for its pointers and memory allocation.

**C main method**: Where the code should be executed first. It looks like this:

```C
int main(void) {
	code to be executed
}
```
