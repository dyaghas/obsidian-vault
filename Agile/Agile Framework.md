#agile

They are used in teams and companies all around the world to make working as a group more efficient. The two most known Agile Frameworks are [[Scrum]] and [[Kanban]]. Scrum follows `sprint` concept, small iterations of work that are more focused and solid when compared to kanban, where work is more flexible and not as rigid.

---------------------------
## User story

`Epic user story`: a large request that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration, it can be split into multiple smaller user stories.
`User story`: the smallest unit of work in an Agile framework.

----------------------------
## Backlog Grooming

In `Backlog Grooming`, the backlogs are analysed, reviewed and prioritized by product managers, product owners and the rest of the team. Large items are split into smaller ones to keep user stories small.

-------------------
## Sprint

An iteration of a continuous development cycle. A certain amount of work is planned to be executed in a sprint, hopefully resulting in a release at the end of it. Sprints are normally around 1-3 weeks long and are defined in a `Sprint Planning` meeting.

----------------------
## Retrospective

Meeting that happens after a sprint where things that went well and the ones that did not go well are discussed. Solutions are given for the problems that happened to make sure they do not happen again.
