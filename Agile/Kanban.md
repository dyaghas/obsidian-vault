`Kanban` does not have proper `sprints` like in Scrum, instead. only the stories and the release date are defined in the board. Because of that, the backlog has all the to-do stories and not only the current `sprint` ones, because there's no `sprint` concept in `Kanban`, all the necessary work is listed in a board without any particular difference.
