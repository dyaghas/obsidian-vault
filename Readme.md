This repository stores all the annotations I made on various topics that I have studied through the years, from programming languages like C and Java to data structures, computer components, and how they work. All the information here can be accessed and used freely, but I do not guarantee the authenticity of any annotations I have done, they are susceptible to errors and should be seen as done by someone who is still learning.
