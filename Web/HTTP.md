#web 

`Hyper Text Transfer Protocol` is a protocol used in the World Wide Web. It allows for the exchange of various types of information, such as: text, images, videos, and other multimedia files. It defines the rules for how data are formatted and transmitted through the web. The request includes methods such as GET (retrieve data), POST (submit data to be processed), and others, indicating the desired action.

Its operation follows a client-server model, where a client sends a request and the server responds with the requested resources or an error message. In this context, servers are represented by domain names associated with an IP, for example: www.google.com

- HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent and not dependent on any previous requests.
- [URLs](URL.md) are used to identify resources on the web. An HTTP request typically includes a URL specifying the location of the resource on the server.
- While HTTP provides the basic framework for web communication, it is not secure for transmitting sensitive information. [[HTTPS]] (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses encryption (SSL/TLS) to secure data transmission.
