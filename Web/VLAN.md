A Virtual Local Area Network segments a physical network into multiple isolated virtual networks. Each separated VLAN functions as an independent network within the larger physical network, providing more security, performance and better management.

Devices on the same VLAN can easily communicate with each other, regardless of their physical location. On the other hand, devices on different VLANs need a router or a layer 3 switch to facilitate communication between them.
