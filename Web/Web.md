#web

The `World Wide Web (WWW)` also known as Web is an information system that allows web resources like documents and downloadable media to be accessed through **web browsers**. Servers and resources on the **World Wide Web** are located through **uniform resource locators** (URLs). The most common document type is a web page formatted in [Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](HTML.md)

Note: [[Internet]] and `World Wide Web` are not the same thing, the former is a global system of computer networks interconnected through telecommunications and optical networking while the latter is a global collection of documents and resources, all linked by `hyperlinks` and `URLs`. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]] protocols.
