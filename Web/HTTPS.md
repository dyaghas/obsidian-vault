`HTTPS`, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is an extension of [[HTTP]] (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) designed to provide a secure and encrypted communication channel over the internet. It adds a layer of security to the data exchanged between a client (such as a web browser) and a server, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.

Encryption is one of the primary features of HTTPS. It uses cryptographic protocols, most commonly SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), to encrypt data transmitted between the client and the server. This encryption ensures that even if the communication is intercepted, the content remains secure.
